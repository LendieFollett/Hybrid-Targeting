## Introduction
This repository contains the code and data required to reproduce the results found in "A Hybrid Approach to Targeting Social Assistance". Specifically, to run simulation studies that estimate out of sample error rates using the Hybrid, Hybrid-AI, Hybrid-EC, and Hybrid-DU models on data from Indonesia (Alatas et al. (2012)) and Burkina Faso (Hillebrecht et al. (2020)). 

## Requirements
To install the required R packages, run the following code in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

install.packages(c("truncnorm", "mvtnorm", "LaplacesDemon", "MASS", "dplyr",
                   "ggplot2", "Rcpp", "reshape2", "caret", "parallel"))

```

## Data

We use two sources of data containing community based rankings, survey information, and consumption/expenditure data. This data can be found in the following sub-directories:

```{r }
list.files("Data/Burkina Faso/Cleaning/")

list.files("Data/Indonesia/Cleaning/")

```

The data files that will be called are "hillebrecht.csv" and "alatas.csv".

## Reproduce

- Run `run_simulations.R` to reproduce error rate results and coefficient estimate results. 
- Run `Burkina Faso Analysis/make_plots.R` to reproduce error rate plots and coefficient plots for the Burkina Faso data. 
- Run `Indonesia Analysis/make_plots.R` to reproduce error rate plots and coefficient plots for the Indonesia data.
